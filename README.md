# ToneGrid

Inspired by Audiotool's [Tone Matrix](http://tonematrix.audiotool.com/).

Final partner project for Data Structures (CS230) course at Wellesley College. ToneGrid is a musical Java application with a grid of boxes where each column represents a beat and each row represents a pitch. The program plays continuously through the grid and (looping back to the beginning when it hits the end), and a user can select or deselect any box at any time, play/pause, or save/load patterns. We used the Java music API JFugue. 

Try it out! To run, cd into the the ToneGrid folder and type in the terminal:
```
javac ToneGridGUI.java
java ToneGridGUI
```
